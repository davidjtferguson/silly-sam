# silly-sam

A game by Davbo and Rory~

Physics based silly movement joke toy thing.

# Getting Started

Things you'd need to download and learn
- Love2D for the game creation framework
- Tiled for creating the maps

Basics I'm using
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash

# Controls

Xbox controller recommended.

When on the ground left bumper puts a force up Sam's leg to make them move left, and right bumper puts a force up Sam's leg to make them move right.
F and J have the same effect.

The left and right sticks make Sam's arms point at the same angle you put the stick in.
So if you push both sticks up Sam will hold their arms in the air.

# Projects we're using to make this (thanks so much for making these things!!)
