# silly-sam

A game by Davbo and Rory~

Physics based silly movement joke toy thing.

## Getting Started

Things you'd need to download and learn
- Love2D for the game creation framework
- Tiled for creating the maps

Basics I'm using
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash

## Controls

Xbox controller recommended.

### Joystick controls

When on the ground left bumper puts a force up Sam's leg to make them move left, and right bumper puts a force up Sam's leg to make them move right.

The left and right sticks make Sam's arms point at the same angle you put the stick in.
So if you push both sticks up Sam will hold their arms in the air.

### Keyboard controls

C shuffles Sam left, N shuffles sam right.

Use WASD to direct the left arm and IJKL to direct the right arm.

## Branch labels

Each branch should be named with a prefix to explain what kind of content is in the branch.

- feature/[name]. This is for a new feature, coding wise.
- fix/[name]. This is for a bug fix or fixing a tech debt issue.
- map/[name]. This is a PR focussed on making a new section of map or editing a map.
- art/[name]. This is a branch for adding new art assets to the project. These branches should only be the addition of the art asset and a little code to implement it.

## Projects we're using to make this (thanks so much for making these things!!)
